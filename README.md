# List

This library implements three variations of linked lists:

- Singly linked list, with `s_list`and `s_list_item`.
- Singly linked list with a tail reference, with `t_list`and `s_list_item`.
- Doubly linker list, with `d_list`and `d_list_item`.

## TODO

Some things are still left to do.

- [ ] Complete the implementation of d_list.
- [ ] Write unit tests for d_list.

## Installation

Simply running `make` will build the static library file `liblist.a` and place it in the `lib` directory. Run `make test` to compile and run the tests found in the `tests` directory. `make clean` will remove all output generated by the build system.

The source files include argument checks that, while useful in development should be removed in production. Defining the constant `NDEBUG` does just that, so either run `make library CC="gcc -DNDEBUG"` or add `-DNDEBUG` to the variable `CPPFLAGS`.

## Usage

```c
#include <list.h>

void use_list() {
  s_list_item_t item;
  s_list_t      list;
  
  s_list_item__ctor(&item);
  s_list__ctor(&item);
  
  /* Put items at the head of the list */
  s_list__unshift(&list, &item);
  
  /* Or at the tail. Note that this is much more efficient 
     with the t_list since the s_list has to first search
     for the tail. */
  s_list__push(&list, &item);
}
```
